    <ul>
        <li style="width:50%; text-align: left; margin-left;" >I was one of the students of KodeGo Bootcamp last April 2023 that lasted 4 months of Virtual Class. I was able to unlocked one of my bucket list: to
        to enroll and learn how to code. Although I have c language experience before in my college days but it was not taught by the school it's a self taught to run a arduino program for a thesis project. In that 
        memories, I always told myself to try coding again as my instructor always said that learning doesnt stop after school. In Kodego, I learned a lot,despite of struggles to code and don't know what's the next
        step but the instructor in KodeGo are very accomodating in terms questions and taught well. </li>
